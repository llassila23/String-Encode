// String Encode C Project
// Created by Lucas Lassila on 8/9/23.
// Initial Commit 8/9/23
// This program is designed to use a string to encode data that will be used to print a picture to console

/* each char in the string will represent a number, The number will determine what action is completed
    To draw the picture we need to know:
    1. start a new line?
    2. What char to print?
    3. how many of said char to print?
// The main body of the program could be handled by a for each loop with if else statements to call printing

// Once completed: it could be done in reverse; enter lines and convert them to a string.
